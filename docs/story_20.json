  "story": "In the center of Hopeful Town stood an old wishing well that everyone believed was magic. People would throw in coins and make wishes, but their wishes never seemed to come true. Young Emma discovered the well's secret - it didn't grant wishes, but it did something better. The well collected all the kind wishes people made for others (not for themselves) and somehow made those wishes find their way to the right people. Emma's wish for her sick neighbor to feel better was carried by the wind to the neighbor, who felt loved and got better faster. Emma learned that the most powerful magic happens when we wish good things for others instead of just for ourselves.",

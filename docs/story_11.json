  "story": "The Sandman was getting old and needed help bringing sweet dreams to all the children in the world. He chose a young girl named Sophie to be his helper. Sophie was given a pouch of magical dream sand and taught how to sprinkle it gently over sleeping children's eyes. Each grain of sand contained a different wonderful dream - adventures in space, playing with friendly animals, or flying through cotton candy clouds. Sophie learned that her job was one of the most important in the world because good dreams help children wake up happy and ready for new adventures.",

When she helped her little brother tie his shoes, a blue bead appeared. When she shared her lunch with a hungry classmate, a yellow bead appeared. But when Zoe was mean or selfish, beads would disappear. At first, Zoe tried to be kind just to collect beads, but soon she realized that the real magic wasn't in the bracelet - it was in how good it felt to be kind to others. The bracelet had taught her that kindness creates its own rewards.",

  "story": "High up in the sky lived a little cloud named Nimbus who felt very lonely. All the other clouds were big and fluffy, but Nimbus was small and wispy. One hot summer day, a little boy on the ground was playing soccer and got very tired from the heat. Nimbus floated over and provided shade for the boy. Soon, other children joined under Nimbus's cool shadow. The little cloud realized that being small meant he was perfect for helping just a few friends at a time, and that made him very special indeed.",

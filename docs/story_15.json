  "story": "Drake was a young dragon who had a big problem - instead of roaring like other dragons, he could only whisper. The other dragons laughed at him, and Drake felt very embarrassed. One day, a lost little girl was crying in the forest. Drake's gentle whisper was exactly what she needed to feel calm and safe. He whispered directions to help her find her way home, and his soft voice didn't scare her at all. Drake realized that being different wasn't a problem - it was his special gift. He became known as the Helper Dragon, using his gentle whisper to comfort anyone who needed a friend.",

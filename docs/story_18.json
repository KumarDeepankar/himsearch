  "story": "Near the village of Cheerful Creek ran a river that could laugh. Whenever someone told a joke or did something silly near the water, the river would giggle and babble with joy. But the river hadn't laughed in months because everyone in the village had become too serious and forgotten how to have fun. A young boy named Charlie decided to help. He spent every day by the river telling jokes, making funny faces, and being silly until the river started laughing again. Soon, other villagers heard the joyful sound and remembered how good it felt to laugh. The whole village became happy again, and Charlie learned that laughter is contagious and can brighten everyone's day.",

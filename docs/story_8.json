  "story": "Luna had a very special job - she was a star collector. Every night, she would climb up to her roof and catch falling stars in her silver net. She kept them in glass jars that glowed softly in her room. But Luna noticed that the stars seemed sad in their jars. One night, she decided to let them all go free. As the stars floated back up to the sky, they spelled out 'Thank You, Luna' in twinkling letters. Luna learned that sometimes the best way to love something is to set it free, and the stars visited her window every night to say hello.",

  "story": "Tommy woke up one morning to find that everything was happening backwards. People walked backwards, clocks ticked backwards, and even his breakfast went from his stomach back onto his plate! At first, Tommy thought it was funny, but then he realized he couldn't talk to his friends properly or learn anything new at school. He discovered that a grumpy wizard had cast a backwards spell on the town because everyone had forgotten to say 'please' and 'thank you.' Tommy led all the children in being extra polite for one whole day, and the spell was broken. Everyone learned that good manners keep the world running smoothly.",

  "story": "Whiskers was a cat who had the amazing ability to turn invisible whenever he wanted. He used this power to help his family - he would invisible-ly chase away mice, find lost socks, and even help his young owner Lucy with her homework by moving pencils to the right answers. But Whiskers felt sad because no one could see him when he was helping. One day, Lucy's mother saw a pencil moving by itself and said, 'Thank you, Whiskers, wherever you are!' Whiskers realized that even when his good deeds went unseen, they were still appreciated, and that made him proud to be a helpful invisible cat.",

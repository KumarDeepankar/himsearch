  "story": "Emma was very shy and never liked to dance at school parties. One day, her grandmother gave her a pair of sparkly red shoes. 'These are dancing shoes,' her grandmother said with a wink. At first, Emma didn't believe it, but when she put them on, her feet started moving to music all by themselves! She danced beautifully at the next school party. Later, Emma realized the shoes weren't really magic - wearing them had just given her the confidence she needed. She learned that sometimes we already have everything we need inside us; we just need something to help us believe in ourselves.",

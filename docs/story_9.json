  "story": "Hoot was a little owl who worried about everything. He worried about flying too high, about making friends, about whether his hooting was loud enough. His worries kept him awake during the day when owls are supposed to sleep. His wise grandmother told him, 'Worry is like a rocking chair - it gives you something to do but doesn't get you anywhere.' She taught Hoot to take deep breaths and think of three good things whenever he felt worried. Soon, Hoot learned that most of his worries never came true, and he could enjoy being a young owl.",

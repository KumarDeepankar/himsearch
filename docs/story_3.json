  "story": "In Mrs. Green's garden, the vegetables had a secret - they could sing! Every night when the moon was bright, the carrots would hum deep bass notes, the peas would chirp high melodies, and the tomatoes would keep the beat. But they only sang when no humans were around. One evening, a little rabbit named Rosie discovered their concert. Instead of running away scared, she asked if she could join in. The vegetables were delighted to have an audience and taught Rosie that music sounds even better when shared with friends.",

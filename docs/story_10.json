  "story": "Behind Mia's house was an old garden gate that everyone said led nowhere. But Mia discovered that when she said 'please' and 'thank you' to the gate, it would open to different magical places. Sometimes it led to a candy forest, sometimes to a beach where mermaids played, and sometimes to a mountain where friendly dragons lived. But the gate would only open for children who were kind and polite. Mia's rude neighbor Ben could never get the gate to open, no matter how hard he pushed. Mia learned that magic responds to kindness, and she shared this secret with Ben, helping him become more polite too.",

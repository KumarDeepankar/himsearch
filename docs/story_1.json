  "story": "Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Maya who loved to paint. One day, she found an old paintbrush in her grandmother's attic. When she dipped it in paint and drew a butterfly, the butterfly came to life and flew off the paper! Maya realized she had found a magic paintbrush. She painted flowers that bloomed with sweet scents, birds that sang beautiful songs, and a rainbow that made everyone in her town smile. But when she tried to paint herself a mountain of candy, the paintbrush wouldn't work. Maya learned that the magic only worked when she painted things to make others happy, not just herself.",

  "story": "The Johnson family moved into a very strange house where everything was upside-down - the furniture hung from the ceiling, the stairs went downward to the second floor, and they had to walk on the ceiling! At first, young Jake was frustrated because everything was so difficult. But then he realized that living upside-down meant he saw the world from a completely different perspective. He could see the tops of trees, watch birds up close, and notice beautiful things he'd never seen before. When the magic spell on the house finally wore off, Jake missed his upside-down view and learned that sometimes changing your perspective can show you wonderful new things.",

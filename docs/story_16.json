  "story": "Grandpa gave Lily a small wooden box that he called a Memory Box. 'Put your favorite memories inside,' he said, 'and they'll stay safe forever.' Lily didn't understand how memories could fit in a box, but she tried anyway. She put in a shell from her beach vacation, a photo of her pet hamster, and a ticket from her first movie. Years later, when Lily was feeling sad, she opened the box. As soon as she touched each item, the happy memories came flooding back so clearly that she could almost smell the ocean and hear her hamster squeaking. Lily learned that the most precious treasures aren't gold or jewels, but the memories we make with people we love.",

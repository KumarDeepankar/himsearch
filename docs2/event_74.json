Develop case study documentation from successful projects demonstrated at the 2024 conference for wider distribution beyond attendees. Establish a scholarship program to include participants from under-resourced regions who bring frontline perspectives on open source software challenges. Create public engagement events alongside the professional conference so broader communities understand the importance of open source software and support necessary policy changes and investments.",

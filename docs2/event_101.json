Develop case study documentation from successful projects demonstrated at the 2023 conference for wider distribution beyond attendees. Establish a scholarship program to include participants from under-resourced regions who bring frontline perspectives on patient-centered care challenges. Create public engagement events alongside the professional conference so broader communities understand the importance of patient-centered care and support necessary policy changes and investments.",

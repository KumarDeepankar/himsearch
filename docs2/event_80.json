Develop case study documentation from successful projects demonstrated at the 2024 conference for wider distribution beyond attendees. Establish a scholarship program to include participants from under-resourced regions who bring frontline perspectives on vaccine development challenges. Create public engagement events alongside the professional conference so broader communities understand the importance of vaccine development and support necessary policy changes and investments.",
